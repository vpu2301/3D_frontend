## Authentication Guard

`src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx` wraps protected routes. It reads `localStorage.getItem("isAuthenticated")` and redirects to `/login` if the value is not `"true"`.

```tsx
// Usage in App.tsx
<Route
  path="/dashboard"
  element={
    <ProtectedRoute>
      <Dashboard />
    </ProtectedRoute>
  }
/>
```

## 404 Handling

A catch-all `*` route at the bottom of the router renders a "Not Found" page.
