# AI-Native Notes (frontend, mocked)

Notes is a sibling module to **Docs** and **Calendar** inside the same 3days.ai shell. Capture-first, lighter than Docs, with cross-module wiki-links and a backlink graph. Like Docs, it is fully client-side and AI is mocked.

## Run it

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# → http://localhost:8080/notes
```

First visit seeds 15 example notes across 2 notebooks (Work, Personal), with cross-links into seeded docs.

## Demo path (≈3 min)

1. **Open Notes** from the right-rail Apps bar (next to Calendar/Docs). Land on `/notes` with the 3-pane layout: notebooks/tags/smart views on the left, note list in the middle, editor on the right.
2. **Quick capture from anywhere.** Press `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+N` from any page in the platform. The floating composer opens. Type "Met with Jules — push back on auto-tagging UX, suggest 3+ keyword threshold" and press `Cmd/Ctrl+Enter` (or click "Save & open"). The note saves and you land in it.
3. **Wiki-link to a doc.** In any note, type `[[` — the autocomplete shows all your notes, docs, and (mock) calendar events. Pick "PRD — Inline AI commands" → a chip-style link is inserted. The doc-side outgoing link is recorded in the notes store, and the new note shows up under the target's backlinks.
4. **Tag inline.** Type `#research` mid-paragraph. The tag chip renders inline; the tag now appears in the left sidebar and counts the note. Click the chip to filter.
5. **Set a reminder.** Click the bell icon in the editor toolbar (or type `/remind` and pick from the slash menu) → enter a time. The reminder chip appears under the title with a "Mirrored to Calendar" badge. The reminder also gets a `calendarEventId` recorded — Calendar can read this when the calendar-side panel ships (data layer is wired).
6. **Extract tasks.** Open "Q2 kickoff — quick capture" (seeded). Highlight a paragraph. In the bubble menu, click the wand → **Extract tasks**. Mock AI streams a task list and inserts it after the selection.
7. **Ask across notes.** Click the **AI** button in the editor toolbar. The right-hand sidebar opens. Ask "What did I decide about diff-accept this week?" → the assistant streams an answer and renders citation chips that route directly to the source notes.
8. **Graph view.** Sidebar → **Graph**. SVG force-directed layout of notes-as-nodes and wiki-links-as-edges. Filter by tag. Click a node to open.
9. **Daily note.** Sidebar → **Today**. Auto-creates today's daily note with a template (date + intent + tasks + notes), or opens it if it already exists.

## Architecture

Notes mirrors the Docs file layout (already aligned with Calendar):

```
src/pages/notes/
  NotesHome.tsx          ← 3-pane layout (sidebar / list / editor) + AI sidebar
  NotesDaily.tsx         ← /notes/daily — ensures + redirects to today's note
  NotesGraph.tsx         ← /notes/graph — SVG force-directed graph
  NotesTrash.tsx         ← /notes/trash
  _components/
    shared/NotesLayout.tsx
    sidebar/NotesSidebar.tsx          ← notebooks, tags, smart views, navigation
    list/NotesList.tsx                ← filtered/sorted list with task rollup chips
    list/NotesListToolbar.tsx         ← search + sort + filter
    editor/
      NoteEditor.tsx                  ← TipTap host (300 ms autosave, AI tag suggestions)
      NoteEditorTopBar.tsx
      NoteSuggestedTags.tsx           ← AI auto-tag chip strip
      NoteTagsRow.tsx
      NoteRemindersRow.tsx
      NoteBacklinksPanel.tsx
      NoteBubbleMenu.tsx              ← Extract tasks/decisions + standard presets
      NoteSlashMenu.tsx               ← /remind, /tag, [[ helpers, normal blocks
      WikiLinkAutocomplete.tsx        ← [[ overlay across notes/docs/events
    ai/NotesAiSidebar.tsx             ← Q&A over (note + linked + recent) with citations
    quick-capture/QuickCapture.tsx    ← global Cmd+Shift+N floating composer
  _hooks/
    use-notes-store.ts                ← Zustand: CRUD, tags, links, reminders, daily note
    use-notes-ui-store.ts             ← selection / sort / filter / sidebar state
  _lib/
    types.ts
    storage.ts                        ← idb-keyval (separate dbs); re-exports docs storage
    seed.ts                           ← 15 notes, 2 notebooks, cross-links into docs
    backlinks.ts                      ← deriveTitle/Snippet, computeBacklinks, extractInlineTags
    extensions/
      wikiLink.tsx                    ← inline node, [[label]] chip with route per type
      inlineTag.tsx                   ← inline node for #tag
      reminder.tsx                    ← block node for reminders
```

### Reuse from Docs (the integration story)

| Docs primitive | Reused as-is in Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `pages/docs/_lib/mockAi.ts` | Same module — *extended* with `extractTasks`, `extractDecisions`, `suggestTags`, `suggestLinks`, `answerOverNotes`. |
| `pages/docs/_lib/storage.ts` | Re-exported via `pages/notes/_lib/storage.ts` (`newId`, `docsStorage`); Notes adds three IDB stores of its own. |
| `pages/docs/_lib/extensions/ghostText.ts` | Same TipTap extension. |
| `pages/docs/_lib/export.ts` | `toMarkdown` powers the per-note `.md` export. |
| `pages/docs/_hooks/use-docs-settings-store.ts` | Same settings (font, page width, mock failure rate, ghost text). |
| `components/dashboard/AppSidebar` + `SidebarProvider` + `SidebarInset` | Identical platform shell. |

### Routes (added to existing `App.tsx`)

| Path | Component |
| --- | --- |
| `/notes` | NotesHome (auto-selects most recent note) |
| `/notes/:id` | NotesHome |
| `/notes/notebook/:id` | NotesHome (filtered) |
| `/notes/tag/:tag` | NotesHome (filtered) |
| `/notes/daily` | NotesDaily → redirects to today's note |
| `/notes/graph` | NotesGraph |
| `/notes/trash` | NotesTrash |

All wrapped in `ProtectedRoute` to match the rest of the platform.

### Cross-module touchpoints (what's wired)

- **Notes → Docs**: every note's outgoing `links` can include doc targets. The `[[` autocomplete pulls from `useDocsStore` for live suggestions. Wiki-link chips route to `/docs/:id`. Backlinks panel surfaces both directions.
- **Notes → Calendar**: every reminder is created with a `calendarEventId` (mock) — the data shape Calendar can consume to render an "Attached notes" panel and a tentative event chip. The current Calendar UI does not yet render this surface (deferred); see "Deferred" below.
- **Calendar → Notes**: the wiki-link autocomplete includes mock event candidates so the link UX is visible end-to-end.
- **Quick capture is platform-global**: mounted in `App.tsx`. `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+N` works inside Docs, Calendar, or anywhere else.
- **PlatformAppsBar**: the Notes tile is now active (was `comingSoon`), routing to `/notes`.

### Deferred / would-need calendar repo touch

- **Calendar-side "Attached notes" panel.** Notes already produce `calendarEventId` mirrors and a `links: { type: 'event' }` shape. To complete the round trip the `CalendarPage` (or the event detail dialog) would need a small read-only panel that calls `useNotesStore` and filters by `links.targetId === event.id`. This is a ~30-line addition; keeping it out of this pass to avoid touching the calendar module without explicit scope.
- **Global command palette `Cmd+K` "New note"/"Open daily" actions.** The platform's existing palette would need a small additional source. Not modified here.
- **Global search** rolling notes into the existing search results. Same reason.

## Mock AI extensions

All extensions live in `src/pages/docs/_lib/mockAi.ts` (extended in place per the spec):

```ts
extractTasks(text)                         // -> MockTask[]
extractDecisions(text)                     // -> MockDecision[]
suggestTags(noteContent, existingTags)     // -> string[]
suggestLinks(noteContent, candidates)      // -> MockLinkSuggestion[]
answerOverNotes(question, notes)           // AsyncIterable<{ chunk, citations? }>
```

Same latency model (200–800 ms initial, 15–40 ms per chunk), same configurable failure rate, same `AbortSignal` support as the rest of the module.

## State + persistence

- **`useNotesStore`**: notes dict, notebooks dict, CRUD, pinning (capped at 5), tags, link add/remove, reminder add/dismiss, suggested-tag accept/dismiss, daily-note resolver.
- **`useNotesUiStore`**: selection, sort, filter, view mode, AI sidebar open, quick-capture open, smart-view selection.
- **Persistence**: `idb-keyval` with three separate databases — `ai-notes-notes`, `ai-notes-notebooks`, `ai-notes-meta` — same constraint as Docs (multi-store-per-DB upgrade collisions in idb-keyval).
- **Backlinks** derived (not stored), recomputed on read in `_lib/backlinks.ts`.
- **Inline tags**: every save re-extracts `#tag` patterns from the body and merges them into the note's `tags` array.

## Acceptance status

- [x] Notes appears in the global apps bar; landing on `/notes` shows seed data.
- [x] Notes UI uses the platform shell, design tokens, shadcn primitives — same chrome as Docs.
- [x] `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+N` opens quick capture from anywhere.
- [x] Create / edit / tag / pin / move-to-notebook / delete / restore — all persist.
- [x] Wiki-links resolve to notes, docs, and (mock) events; backlinks panel populates.
- [x] AI surfaces wired to shared `mockAi.ts` (inline command via bubble menu, selection presets including Extract tasks/decisions, sidebar Q&A over notes, auto-tag chip strip).
- [x] Reminders write a mock `calendarEventId` (calendar consumes from the notes store).
- [x] Daily note auto-creates and uses the template.
- [x] Graph view renders, is filterable, opens notes on click.
- [x] Markdown export from the editor toolbar.
- [x] No new design tokens, no forked primitives, no duplicated AI module.
- [x] Vitest covers `useNotesStore` (CRUD, tags, pinning cap, links, reminders, daily, smart views), backlink computation + tag extraction + title derivation, and the new mock AI methods. **30 new tests, 68 total across the platform**.

## Stretch (not implemented)

- Bulk export of all notes as a zip
- Markdown paste cleanup via mock AI
- Voice-to-note via Web Speech API
- Live link suggestion strip while typing (the data layer exists; UI deferred)
- Templates beyond daily

## Keyboard shortcuts (Notes-specific additions on top of Docs')

- `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + N` — Quick capture (global, anywhere in the platform)
- `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + I` — Toggle Notes AI sidebar
- `Cmd/Ctrl + Enter` (in quick capture) — Save & open the note
- `[[` — Wiki-link autocomplete
- `#word` — Inline tag
- `/` — Slash menu (with `/remind` for reminders)
