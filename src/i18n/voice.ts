/**
 * Owner-app i18n (FE-BINDING: "i18n init + namespaces").
 *
 * The platform's i18next instance (`src/i18n/index.ts`) owns the marketing
 * `translation` namespace with English as its fallback. The owner app is
 * German-first (Block I rule 3), so its namespaces are registered here and
 * resolved through `useVoiceT`, which reads the owner app's own locale from
 * the session store — `de` unless the browser or an explicit choice says
 * English — instead of the platform's detected language. A French or
 * Ukrainian browser therefore sees German in the owner app and English on the
 * marketing site, which is what each audience expects.
 *
 * Namespaces are one file per feature: `voice-common`, `voice-nav`, … Add a
 * feature namespace in both languages (`scripts/i18n-check.mjs` fails on
 * missing keys) and list it in VOICE_NAMESPACES.
