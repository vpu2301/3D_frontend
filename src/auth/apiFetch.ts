/**
 * Authenticated fetch for the standalone Notes service (`notes_app`).
 *
 * Sprint 0 §3.2 specified an OIDC wrapper; **ADR 0001 superseded that** — no
 * Zitadel. What ships is the auth 3days already has: the Pincer shared bearer
 * token plus the per-browser UUID sent as `X-Pincer-User`. The service rejects
 * a request missing *either* header, so both are always set together.
 *
 * The token is deliberately read through `pincerClient`'s `authHeaders()`
 * instead of re-reading `pincer.web.auth` here — one place knows the storage
 * keys. When OIDC eventually lands, this file is the only thing that changes.
 *
 * Known limit, recorded because it is easy to forget: the token is shared and
 * `X-Pincer-User` is client-asserted, so anyone holding the token can claim any
 * user id. Pilot-grade, not §203-grade (ADR 0001).
