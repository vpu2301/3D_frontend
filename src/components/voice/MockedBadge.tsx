/**
 * Kept deliberately, with one badge left on the page (live listen-in).
 *
 * S16 took sentiment and talk ratio off this list; what remains needs call
 * audio in a browser, and there is no endpoint or media proxy that can supply
 * it. The component stays regardless of the count: the next surface that ships
 * ahead of its backend needs it, and the inventory test
 * (src/test/voice/mockInventory.test.ts) is what keeps the count honest.
 */
/**
 * De-mock task contract: anything the backend cannot serve yet stays visible
 * but is *unmistakably* labelled as mock, with the reason and (where known)
 * the follow-up that will replace it. Three pieces:
 *
 *   <MockedBadge />        – the amber pill itself
 *   <MockedSection />      – a card for an in-page section that is still mock
 *   <MockedRouteBanner />  – a full-width strip on top of a whole mocked view
 *
 * The two container variants carry `data-mock="true"` on their root element so
 * the inventory is countable — from the DOM in a test, and from the source with
 * a grep. `src/test/voice/mockInventory.test.ts` pins the exact count for the
 * Voice page, so de-mocking something is a deliberate edit to that number
 * rather than a badge that quietly disappears.
